        <p>In recent years, automated text classification has become a very important tool in the legal industry. (Jackson &
            Moulinier, 2002) write: “There is no question concerning the commercial value of being able to classify documents
            automatically by content. There are myriad potential applications of such a capability for corporate Intranets,
            government departments, and Internet publishers.” Obviously, the ability to automatically classify legal documents
            contributes to the increased productivity and efficiency of lawyers and could potentially reduce the millions of
            dollars spent on discovery costs and legal support staff. In this paper, I present the results of my investigation of the
            different NLP models with the goal of finding the best model that is suited for the task of classifying legal
            documents, particularly long-length ones, in this case, the United States Supreme Court decisions</p>
